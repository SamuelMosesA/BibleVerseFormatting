"\t\t\t\t[1] Who has believed what he has heard from us?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?\n\t\t\t\t[2] For he grew up before him like a young plant,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand like a root out of dry ground;\n\t\t\t\the had no form or majesty that we should look at him,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand no beauty that we should desire him.\n\t\t\t\t[3] He was despised and rejected by men,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta man of sorrows and acquainted with grief;\n\t\t\t\tand as one from whom men hide their faces\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\the was despised, and we esteemed him not.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t[4] Surely he has borne our griefs\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand carried our sorrows;\n\t\t\t\tyet we esteemed him stricken,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsmitten by God, and afflicted.\n\t\t\t\t[5] But he was pierced for our transgressions;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\the was crushed for our iniquities;\n\t\t\t\tupon him was the chastisement that brought us peace,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand with his wounds we are healed.\n\t\t\t\t[6] All we like sheep have gone astray;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twe have turned\u2014every one\u2014to his own way;\n\t\t\t\tand the LORD has laid on him\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe iniquity of us all.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t[7] He was oppressed, and he was afflicted,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyet he opened not his mouth;\n\t\t\t\tlike a lamb that is led to the slaughter,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand like a sheep that before its shearers is silent,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tso he opened not his mouth.\n\t\t\t\t[8] By oppression and judgment he was taken away;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand as for his generation, who considered\n\t\t\t\tthat he was cut off out of the land of the living,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstricken for the transgression of my people?\n\t\t\t\t[9] And they made his grave with the wicked\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand with a rich man in his death,\n\t\t\t\talthough he had done no violence,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand there was no deceit in his mouth.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t[10] Yet it was the will of the LORD to crush him;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\the has put him to grief;\n\t\t\t\twhen his soul makes an offering for guilt,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\the shall see his offspring; he shall prolong his days;\n\t\t\t\tthe will of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.\n\t\t\t\t[11] Out of the anguish of his soul he shall see and be satisfied;\n\t\t\t\tby his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmake many to be accounted righteous,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand he shall bear their iniquities.\n\t\t\t\t[12] Therefore I will divide him a portion with the many,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand he shall divide the spoil with the strong,\n\t\t\t\tbecause he poured out his soul to death\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand was numbered with the transgressors;\n\t\t\t\tyet he bore the sin of many,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand makes intercession for the transgressors.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"
